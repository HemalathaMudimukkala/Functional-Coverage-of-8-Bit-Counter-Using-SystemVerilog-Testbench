# Functional-Coverage-of-8-Bit-Counter-Using-SystemVerilog-Testbench
In this project, I developed a comprehensive SystemVerilog testbench to perform functional coverage analysis of an 8-bit counter design. The counter design supports counting up or down based on input control signals. I utilized a structured verification methodology involving multiple components: a generator to produce random transactions and sen it to driver, a driver receives stimuli from generator and apply to the DUT usigng virtual interface, a monitor is to observe and capture responses from DUT using virtual interface and send the responses to scoreboard, and a scoreboard is for comparison and result verification.

The testbench incorporates a detailed coverage group to monitor various states and transitions, including different values of rst, up, load, loadin, and the output y. Cross-coverage points were added to track interactions between these signals, ensuring that all critical scenarios are tested. This approach helped achieve thorough functional coverage and validate the counter's behavior across a wide range of conditions, demonstrating my proficiency in using SystemVerilog for advanced verification tasks.
